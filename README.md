# sql-challenge

This Sql challenge is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.


This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

Data Modeling
From the given CSV files, an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables have been created. 

Data Engineering
Table schema for each of the six CSV files have been created with the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Each CSV file imported into its corresponding SQL table.
